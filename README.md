A better `pnpm install xxx` with prompts and catalogs support.

> [!NOTE]
> This CLI is [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)-specific and opinionated, you might want to check [`@antfu/ni`](https://github.com/antfu-collective/ni) instead.

```bash
pnpm i @antfu/nip
```

```bash
nip vue
```

Then it will prompts you to select the catalog to install the package to, and update `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and `package.json` for you.

You can also explicitly set the catalog with `--catalog` flag.

```bash
nip vue --catalog frontend
```

## Why?

- `pnpm` is currently lacking of the `--catalog` option to directly install packages to catalog, resulting in quite a few manual operations to maintain the catalogs. On the other hand, pnpm's current codebase structure is a bit too complex to add this feature as an outside contributor. So this tool is more like a quick workaround.
- Sometimes the dependency might already presented in the workspace/catalogs. This tool would pick existing version/catalog automatically.
- My workflow might be a bit opinionated (will write a blog post to explain!)

## Todos

- [ ] Support inferring current workspace packages and fill `workspace:*` automatically.
- [ ] Prompts to edit entries (if select "no" in "looks good")
